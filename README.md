## Introduction
Hi, my name is Neil Yeung! I am a high school senior, about to go to college. Here, on my website are a collection of misc. thoughts, posts explaining about some of the coding projects I do.

I use Github in place of blogspot because changes are easier to track and because Github pages is a robust system, and it's free!

## Projects
[GetFit](https://github.com/Genuinely/getfit) is a calorie and running tracker run off the Google Maps API. Can be tied to physical device like an Arduino to become similar to a jawbone in fashion.

[RipplesMeditation](https://github.com/Genuinely/Ripple) is a meditation app targeted towards high schoolers. 

[NLP_Twitter](https://github.com/Genuinely/nlp_twitter) is a natural language processing project that uses the Twitter API.
