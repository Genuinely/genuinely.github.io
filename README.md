Hi, I'm Neil! I'm interesting in scaling large systems, machine learning related or otherwise. I like working on stuff at the edge of theory (research) and practice (engineering). 

I am studying for a B.S. in Computer Science & B.A. in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Rochester; I will graduate May 2023. 

I currently intern at Intel in the Applied Machine Learning Group working on Vision Transformers. I conduct data mining and computer vision research at the [ViSTA Lab]().

For fun, I enjoy [reading books]() and [climbing rocks]().

## Selected Projects
## Deep Generative Models for Bone Lesion Prediction
Metastatic bone lesions can greatly harm patients, reducing outcomes by 2% or more. In collaboration with the University of Denver, we are working on training deep generative models for bone lesion prediction [tumor growth prediction](https://github.com/Genuinely/tumor_prediction). Manuscript to be submitted to a conference or journal. 

## Sentiment Analysis 
I first-authored a paper on sentiment analysis of COVID-19 mask. The paper was accepted to the 2019 IEEE Conference on Data Mining. I was interviewed on my work by the Data Skeptic Podcast.

## Ripples Meditation App
[RipplesMeditation](https://github.com/Genuinely/Ripple) is a meditation app targeted towards high schoolers. Meditation, and mindfullness more generally, has been empirically shown to reduce stress and anxiety.
